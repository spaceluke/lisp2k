# lisp2k
I wrote my own Lisp ... from the future .

![LISP from xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg)



# WHY ?:

Writing a Lisp is a good exercice to practice programming in a language such as C we get to deal with lots of dark C tricks and structuring we manipulate memory and we write a programming language .

Lisp2k was born from the idea of T2000 in the Terminator Series .

##HOW TO COMPILE:
SO YEAH AFTER SPENDING 2 HOURS IN THE ABYSS OF GNU MAKE MANUAL AND STUFF ...
just type this into the terminal :
cc -std=c99 -Wall lisp2k.c mpc.c -ledit -lm -o lisp2k

HAVE FUN HACKING .
