# lisp2k
I wrote my own Lisp ... from the future .

![LISP from xkcd](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/lisp.jpg)



# WHY ?:

Writing a Lisp is a good exercice to practice programming in a language such as C we get to deal with lots of dark C tricks and structuring we manipulate memory and we write a programming language .

Lisp2k was born from the idea of T2000 in the Terminator Series .
